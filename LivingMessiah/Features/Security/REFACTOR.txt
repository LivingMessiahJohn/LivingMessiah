All of the components in LivingMessiah\Features\Security\ do not have a @page directive except for PasswordChanged.razor (which has not yet been implemented).

Considering making a higher level folder  LivingMessiah\Security\ and moving these components there.

This folder would also include the components mentioned about under the folder LivingMessiah\Security\
