# <mark>SukkotLMM</mark> Web App
This is a new App for people to...

### 1. register for Sukkot

### 2. see the schedule and events

It is **NOT** an admin related app 
- Sukkot related functions are handled by the <mark>**LMMAdmin Web App**</mark>, see .Net 7 **SukkotAdmin** stuff

## Type of App?
- PWA and off-line 
- would be useful when your at the event so you can lookup the schedule and events

## RCL <mark>**`RegistrationSteps.rcl`**</mark>
If I created Razor Component Library (RCL) of all the stuff under RegistrationSteps 📁 I could leverage that in <mark>**LMMAdmin Web App**</mark> in such a way that I could mask my self as a user and create their registration for them.
