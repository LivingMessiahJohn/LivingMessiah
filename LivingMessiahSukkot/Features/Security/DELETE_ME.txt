### LeftButton.razor


@* 
	Hack: This was setup so people can get to the Sukkot landing page quickly  
	I do think that this "LeftButton" could be used (and renamed) as an Urgent modal or simple button
	Examples
	- Current status is LandingPageEnums.RegistrationOpen
	- If there's a prayer request
	- 
	Can you have level of DefCon Notification levels, if Urgent then make it blink or do something like that
	upcoming events
	make it so that there is a multiple things and then have a badge super script
